# LeetCodeProblems
A collection of Leet Code problems in C# I've solved as well as example problems and reference materials used for solving those problems from other resources.

Some of these were originally solutions I made in coding interviews, others were done as practice in my own time. 

Also contains examples of data structures and algorithms I use for my own reference.
